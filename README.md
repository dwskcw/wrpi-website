# wrpi-website
Hello! This is the project page for [WRPI.org](www.wrpi.org), the website for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's independent, student-run radio station
located in Troy, NY. Some hands on the wheel! If you'd like to contribute to the project, read on :)

## How to Contribute
Clone our Git repo, make your changes, and make a pull request documenting your changes *as extensively as possible.* Your changes will
be carefully inspected and you may be asked to speak to specific aspects of your work. We greatly appreciate contributions, and know
that your work will be immediately apparent to the dedicated WRPI listeners of New York's Capital Region!

## Issues
Please open an issue if you have any functional issues with the website. If an identical or similar issue already exists, please add a
