# wrpi-website - Design Refactor

Working on left-aligning the site and adding more content to fill in the right side.
Also working to add a section for recorded content, like interviews and WRPI Live
Dept. sessions. **JavaScript requires checking and refactoring,** as do the menu
buttons (see Issue #12).
