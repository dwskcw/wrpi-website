# Design Refactor

## Goals
- Left-aligning the site and adding more content to fill in the right side
- Add a section for recorded content, like interviews and WRPI Live Dept. sessions
- JavaScript requires checking and refactoring
- Polish menu buttons (see Issue #12)
- Footer alignment should also be checked (see Issue #13)

## Relevant Issues
- [Issue #12 - Menu buttons don't retain selected color on mouse-off](https://github.com/khealio/wrpi-website/issues/12)
- [Issues #13 - Footer appears at the bottom of content, not at the absolute bottom of the page](https://github.com/khealio/wrpi-website/issues/13)
